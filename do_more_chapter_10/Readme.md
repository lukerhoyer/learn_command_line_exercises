# Chapter 10: Copy a file (cp)

## Do More
> ***NOTE***: The answers for this chapter should not include the use of cd (change directory).

### Use the cp -r command to copy more directories with files in them.

    cp awesome.txt foo_bar/
    
### Copy a file to your home directory or desktop.

    cp awesome.txt ~/desktop/
    
### Find these files in your graphical user interface and open them in a text editor.

    finder>workspace...>temp>foo_bar>awesome.txt
    
### Notice how sometimes I put a / (slash) at the end of a directory? That makes sure the file is really a directory, so if the directory doesn't exist I'll get an error.
