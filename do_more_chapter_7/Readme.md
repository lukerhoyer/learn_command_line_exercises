# Chapter 7: Remove Directory (rmdir)

## Do More

### Make 20 more directories and remove them all.

    Lukes-MacBook-Pro:temp $ ls
    A new Hope              c                       l
    Attack of the Clones    d                       m
    Goodbye now             deserves                n
    How fun                 e                       o
    I agree                 every                   p
    Indeed it is            f                       q
    It's pretty great       fudge                   r
    Revenge of the Sith     g                       s
    The Empire Strikes Back good                    t
    The Phantom Menace      h                       u
    a                       i                       v
    b                       j
    boy                     k
    
    Lukes-MacBook-Pro:temp $ ls
    A new Hope              Indeed it is            boy
    Attack of the Clones    It's pretty great       deserves
    Goodbye now             Revenge of the Sith     every
    How fun                 The Empire Strikes Back fudge
    I agree                 The Phantom Menace      good

### Make a single path of directories that is 10 deep and remove them one at a time just like I did above.

    Lukes-MacBook-Pro:jasmine $ pwd
    /Users/lukehoyer/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/temp/
    apple/banana/citrus/dragonfruit/eggplant/fruit/grape/horchata/igloo/jasmine
    
    Lukes-MacBook-Pro:temp $ pwd
    /Users/lukehoyer/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2016/homework/learn_command_line_exercises/temp
    
### If you try to remove a directory with contents you will get an error. I'll show you how to remove these in later exercises.
