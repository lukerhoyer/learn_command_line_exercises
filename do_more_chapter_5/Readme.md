## Do More

### cd to the joe directory with one command.

    cd joe/
    
### cd back to temp with one command, but not further above that.

    cd temp or cd ..

### Find out how to cd to your "home directory" with one command.

    cd ../../../
    
### cd to your Documents directory, then find it with your GUI file browser (Finder, Windows Explorer, etc.).

    cd Documents, then finder>documents
 
### cd to your Downloads directory, then find it with your file browser.

    I feel like I am wrong, but it should be on the side bar
    
### Find another directory with your file browser, then cd to it.

    
    
### Remember when you put quotes around a directory with spaces in it? You can do that with any command. For example, if you have a directory I Have Fun, then you can do: cd "I Have Fun"

    Please use markdown formatting listing the command(s) you ran to accomplish this
