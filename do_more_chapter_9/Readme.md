## Do More

### Make a directory, change to it, and then make a file in it. Then change one level up and run the rmdir command in this directory. You should get an error. Try to understand why you got this error.

    The error I got was the the file was not empty, so i ran the "-f" command to force the change.
    touch iamreallycool.txt
